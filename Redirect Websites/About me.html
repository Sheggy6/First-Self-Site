                <h1>Who I am, and where I've been:</h1>
                <h2>A general story:</h2>
                    <p>You may notice the flags on the top there, that would be due to the fact that I have lived in those nations, in that order.
                        It may seem daunting but it's true, at the age of seven I left my home country of Germany and landed in many nations, with intervals of three years before I would leave again (Except for Ireland more on that later).
                    </p>
                    <p>In short, I speak fluent German and English, dabbled around a bit in French and Chinese too (Australia and Ireland taught these languages surprisingly).
                       Learned to love culture, architecture, and the insane differences in the linguistic dialects of these nations. 
                    </p>
                    <p> Naturally however, due to the isolated nature of my lifestyle, I ended up having few friends at first and took solace elsewhere.
                        This was video games, books, and the internet. Which is why I am enjoying this course as much as I am, I now have the possibility
                        to influence a rather integral element that shaped a lot of who I am today.
                    </p>
                    <p> I have a rather simple list of hobbies that are ever expanding, as I am a knowledge thirsty invidual:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Video games (discussion and playing)</li>
                        <li>Movies (watching and discussing)</li>
                        <li>Editing videos for Youtube</li>
                        <li>Cooking and preparation of food products</li>
                        <li>Naturally, programming, it really is a lot of fun</li>
                        <li>Reading, especially history books</li>
                        <li>Camping </li>
                        <li>Going on long walks to get lost (I live in a wonderful part of Berlin, rich with nature) </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>I appreciate the time you are taking to learn a little about me.</p>
